Project Summary -

Telecom companies often struggle with customer churn, which refers to the number of customers who leave the company over a given period. In this project, we aimed to analyze the churn rate of a telecom company and identify the factors that contribute to customer churn.

Problem Statement-

Orange S.A., formerly France Télécom S.A., is a French multinational telecommunications corporation. The Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset, consists of cleaned customer activity data (features), along with a churn label specifying whether a customer cancelled the subscription.
Explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for customer churn and come up with ways/recommendations to ensure customer retention.

Conclusion-

The telecommunications market is already well-established, and the rate of new
customers is slow. As a result, companies in this industry prioritize retention and
reducing customer churn. This project analyzed a churn dataset to identify the
main factors contributing to churn and gain valuable insights. Through exploratory
data analysis, we were able to gain insight into the churn dataset, listed below:

1. The four charge fields are directly related to the minute fields.

2. The area code may not be relevant and can be excluded.

3. Customers with the International Plan tend to churn more often.

4. Customers who have had four or more customer service calls churn significantly more than other customers.

5. Customers with high day and evening minute usage tend to churn at a higher rate.

6. There is no clear relationship between churn and the variables such as day calls, evening calls, night calls, international calls, night minutes, international minutes, account length, or voice mail messages.
